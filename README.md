# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a booking management system

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements of a system or software to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. It is a critical phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that helps define what the system should do before any design or development work begins.
### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Reduces the risk of missing critical features or functionality.
- Prevents costly rework during later stages of development.
- Ensures alignment between stakeholder expectations and delivered software.
- Provides a clear roadmap for developers, testers, and project managers.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Elicitation :
- Collecting requirements from users, stakeholders, and domain experts using interviews, surveys, workshops, use cases, etc.
2. Requirement Analysis :
- Evaluating and prioritizing the collected requirements for clarity, feasibility, and consistency.
3. Requirement Specification :
- Documenting the finalized requirements in a structured format (e.g., Software Requirements Specification - SRS document).
4. Requirement Validation :
- Reviewing and verifying the requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
5. Requirement Management :
- Tracking and controlling changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

  ## Types of Requirements
  ### Functional Requirements
  - User Registration & Login
  - Search for Hotels
  - View Hotel Details
  - Room Booking
  - Payment Processing
  - Booking Confirmation
  - Cancel/Modify Booking
  - Admin Dashboard
 
    ### Non-Functional Requirements
    - Performance
    - Scalability
    - Security
    - Usability
    - Reliability
    - Maintainability
    - Availability
    - Compatibility
    - Recoverability/Fault Tolerance
   
      ## Use Case Diagrams
      A Use Case Diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that visually represents the functionalities of a system from the perspective of its users (actors) . It shows how different actors interact with various use cases , helping to define and clarify the system's scope and boundaries

      ## Purpose of Use Case Diagrams
      - To identify and model user interactions with the system.
      - To capture functional requirements.
      - To provide a high-level view of system behavior.
      - To support communication between developers, clients, and stakeholders.
      - To serve as a foundation for more detailed design and testing phases.

        ### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
        - **Clarity:**Helps understand what the system does without getting into implementation details.
        - **Communication Tool:**Makes it easier to discuss system features with non-technical stakeholders.
        - **Scope Definition:**Clearly defines which functionalities are included in the system.
        - **Requirement Validation:**Assists in identifying missing or redundant requirements early.
        - **Design Guidance:**Guides further modeling like sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc
